        Quaid-e-Azam means “Great Leader” in Urdu, and it’s a title given to Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the man who helped create Pakistan. 
        He was born on December 25, 1876. Jinnah was a smart lawyer and a good leader. He led the All-India Muslim League and asked for a 
        separate country for Muslims. Because of his hard work and strong leadership, Pakistan was made in 1947. People remember him for his 
        determination and leadership during this important time. He became Pakistan’s first leader, and his ideas of working together, having 
        faith, and being disciplined are still important in Pakistan today.
